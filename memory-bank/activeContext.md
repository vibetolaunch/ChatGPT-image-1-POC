# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current State
The project is a functional AI image editing POC with mask-based editing capabilities. **Major UI Redesign Completed**: Implemented floating draggable toolbar and edge-to-edge canvas layout for a modern, professional image editing experience.

## Recent Focus Areas

### 1. **Floating Toolbar Redesign (COMPLETED)**
- **Implementation**: Created `FloatingToolPanel.tsx` component with modern glassmorphism design
- **Key Features**:
  - Draggable positioning anywhere on screen
  - Auto-docking to screen edges when dragged near them
  - Collapsible interface with macOS-style window controls
  - Integrated tool selection (brush, eraser, upload)
  - Real-time controls for brush size, opacity, and color
  - Undo/redo functionality with visual state indicators
- **UX Improvements**: 
  - Tools float over canvas instead of taking fixed header space
  - User can position toolbar based on their workflow preferences
  - Compact design maximizes canvas real estate
- **Files Created**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx`

### 2. **Edge-to-Edge Canvas Layout (COMPLETED)**
- **Implementation**: Created `EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx` for full-viewport canvas experience
- **Key Features**:
  - Canvas extends from edge to edge of screen (no borders/frames)
  - Dark background theme for better image contrast
  - Responsive scaling maintains aspect ratio
  - Gradient border glow effect when image is loaded
  - Full-screen drag-and-drop overlay
  - Centered canvas with proper viewport calculations
- **Visual Impact**:
  - Removed gray container backgrounds
  - Eliminated fixed layout constraints
  - Professional dark theme aesthetic
  - Maximum canvas space utilization
- **Files Created**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx`

### 3. **Unified Canvas Refactor (COMPLETED)**
- **Major Refactor**: Completely rewrote `UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx` to integrate new components
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Replaced fixed toolbar with floating panel system
  - Integrated edge-to-edge canvas layout
  - Maintained all existing functionality (drawing, upload, history)
  - Improved event handling for pointer-based drawing
  - Preserved drag-and-drop file upload capabilities
- **Code Quality**: 
  - Cleaner component separation
  - Better TypeScript interfaces
  - Improved state management
  - Enhanced error handling
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`

### 4. **Previous Fixes Maintained**
- **File Upload Dialog Fix**: Preserved solution preventing unintended upload dialogs
- **Canvas Layering**: Maintained transparent painting layer over background images
- **Provider Integration**: All existing AI provider functionality intact

## Active Decisions & Preferences

### UI/UX Patterns (Updated)
- **Floating Interface**: Movable toolbar over fixed header approach
- **Edge-to-Edge Design**: Maximum canvas space utilization
- **Dark Theme**: Professional editing environment with better contrast
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern semi-transparent floating panels
- **Responsive Positioning**: Auto-docking and viewport-aware positioning
- **Minimal Distractions**: Tools available but not intrusive

### Technical Patterns (Enhanced)
- **Component Separation**: Dedicated components for toolbar and canvas
- **Ref-based Communication**: Canvas access through imperative handles
- **Event Delegation**: Proper pointer event handling for drawing
- **Responsive Design**: Viewport-aware scaling and positioning
- **State Management**: Centralized tool state with callback patterns

### Configuration Choices
- **Canvas Dimensions**: 800x600 base with responsive scaling
- **History Limit**: 20 undo/redo states for performance
- **Auto-dock Distance**: 20px snap threshold for edge docking
- **Default Tool State**: Brush tool, 20px size, 80% opacity, black color

## Current Challenges

### 1. **OpenAI Integration Gap**
- **Issue**: ChatGPT-image-1 provider not yet implemented
- **Blocker**: Requires organization verification
- **Impact**: Missing key differentiator of the POC
- **Next Step**: Complete OpenAI provider implementation

### 2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Issue**: Floating toolbar may need mobile-specific adaptations
- **Consideration**: Touch-friendly controls and positioning
- **Status**: Desktop-first implementation complete

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- **Issue**: Large image handling could be optimized
- **Consideration**: Canvas rendering performance with complex masks
- **Status**: Functional but could be enhanced

## Next Steps Priority

### High Priority
1. **Mobile Optimization**: Adapt floating toolbar for touch devices
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate with large images and complex masks
3. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on new interface design

### Medium Priority
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add hotkeys for tool switching and actions
2. **Zoom Controls**: Integrate zoom functionality into floating panel
3. **Mini-map**: Add navigation aid for large canvases

### Low Priority
1. **Theme Customization**: Allow light/dark theme switching
2. **Toolbar Presets**: Save/load toolbar positions and configurations
3. **Advanced Tools**: Additional brush types and effects

## Important Patterns & Learnings

### Floating UI Implementation
- **Drag Handling**: Use pointer events with proper offset calculations
- **Boundary Constraints**: Keep panels within viewport bounds
- **Auto-docking**: Smooth snapping to edges with visual feedback
- **Z-index Management**: Proper layering for floating elements
- **State Persistence**: Maintain panel positions across interactions

### Canvas Architecture
- **Dual Canvas System**: Background for images, transparent overlay for painting
- **Responsive Scaling**: Maintain aspect ratio while filling viewport
- **Event Coordination**: Proper event handling between components
- **Ref Communication**: Use imperative handles for canvas access
- **Performance**: Efficient drawing with interpolated brush strokes

### Component Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct components for UI and canvas logic
- **Props Interface**: Clean API boundaries between components
- **State Management**: Centralized state with callback patterns
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for component interfaces
- **Reusability**: Components designed for potential reuse

## Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` with proper environment variables
2. **Component Testing**: Individual component validation
3. **Integration Testing**: Full workflow testing with new UI
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across browsers

## UI Redesign Summary
The image editor now features a modern, professional interface with:
- **Floating draggable toolbar** that can be positioned anywhere on screen
- **Edge-to-edge canvas** with no borders or frames for maximum workspace
- **Dark theme** for better visual contrast and professional appearance
- **Glassmorphism design** with semi-transparent floating panels
- **Auto-docking** toolbar that snaps to screen edges
- **Preserved functionality** with all existing features intact

This redesign transforms the editor from a traditional fixed-layout interface to a modern, flexible workspace that adapts to user preferences and maximizes canvas real estate.
