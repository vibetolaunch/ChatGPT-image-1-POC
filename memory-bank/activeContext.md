# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current State
The project is a functional AI image editing POC with mask-based editing capabilities. **Major UI Redesign Completed**: Implemented floating draggable toolbar and edge-to-edge canvas layout for a modern, professional image editing experience. **Apply to Canvas Fix Completed**: Fixed critical bug where AI-generated results couldn't be applied to the canvas. **Drag Performance Optimization Completed**: Fixed laggy dragging behavior in floating toolbar with requestAnimationFrame and optimized DOM queries. **Auto-Repositioning Feature Completed**: Added intelligent repositioning when expanding toolbar to prevent off-screen content.

## Recent Focus Areas

### 1. **Apply to Canvas Fix (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)**
- **Issue**: "Apply to Canvas" button in AI modal had TODO comment and wasn't functional
- **Root Cause**: Button only closed modal without applying the AI-generated result
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `onApplyToCanvas` callback prop to `AIPromptModal` component
  - Implemented `handleApplyToCanvas` function in `UnifiedPaintingCanvas`
  - Function loads AI result, updates background image, clears mask, saves to history
- **Implementation Details**:
  - AI result becomes new background image with proper dimensions
  - Painting canvas (mask) automatically cleared since edit is applied
  - State saved to history for undo functionality
  - Error handling for image loading failures
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/AIPromptModal.tsx`
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Users can now seamlessly apply AI edits to canvas and continue editing

### 2. **Floating Toolbar Redesign (COMPLETED)**
- **Implementation**: Created `FloatingToolPanel.tsx` component with modern glassmorphism design
- **Key Features**:
  - Draggable positioning anywhere on screen
  - Auto-docking to screen edges when dragged near them
  - Collapsible interface with macOS-style window controls
  - Integrated tool selection (brush, eraser, upload)
  - Real-time controls for brush size, opacity, and color
  - Undo/redo functionality with visual state indicators
- **UX Improvements**: 
  - Tools float over canvas instead of taking fixed header space
  - User can position toolbar based on their workflow preferences
  - Compact design maximizes canvas real estate
- **Files Created**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx`

### 3. **Edge-to-Edge Canvas Layout (COMPLETED)**
- **Implementation**: Created `EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx` for full-viewport canvas experience
- **Key Features**:
  - Canvas extends from edge to edge of screen (no borders/frames)
  - Dark background theme for better image contrast
  - Responsive scaling maintains aspect ratio
  - Gradient border glow effect when image is loaded
  - Full-screen drag-and-drop overlay
  - Centered canvas with proper viewport calculations
- **Visual Impact**:
  - Removed gray container backgrounds
  - Eliminated fixed layout constraints
  - Professional dark theme aesthetic
  - Maximum canvas space utilization
- **Files Created**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx`

### 4. **Unified Canvas Refactor (COMPLETED)**
- **Major Refactor**: Completely rewrote `UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx` to integrate new components
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Replaced fixed toolbar with floating panel system
  - Integrated edge-to-edge canvas layout
  - Maintained all existing functionality (drawing, upload, history)
  - Improved event handling for pointer-based drawing
  - Preserved drag-and-drop file upload capabilities
- **Code Quality**: 
  - Cleaner component separation
  - Better TypeScript interfaces
  - Improved state management
  - Enhanced error handling
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`

### 5. **Drag Performance Optimization (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)**
- **Issue**: Floating toolbar dragging was laggy and not performant
- **Root Causes**:
  - Excessive re-renders during drag operations
  - Heavy DOM calculations (`getBoundingClientRect()`) on every mousemove
  - Inefficient auto-docking logic running continuously
  - CSS transitions interfering with smooth dragging
- **Solution**: 
  - **requestAnimationFrame**: Used RAF for smooth position updates instead of direct state changes
  - **Dimension Caching**: Cache panel dimensions to avoid repeated DOM queries during drag
  - **Passive Event Listeners**: Added `{ passive: true }` to mousemove events for better performance
  - **Optimized Auto-docking**: Moved auto-dock logic to drag end instead of continuous checking
  - **Conditional Transitions**: Disable CSS transitions during drag, re-enable when not dragging
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `animationFrameRef` to manage RAF calls and prevent stacking
  - Created `panelDimensionsRef` to cache width/height and avoid DOM queries
  - Modified CSS classes to conditionally apply transitions based on drag state
  - Used functional state updates to prevent stale closure issues
  - Added proper cleanup for animation frames in useEffect
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx`
- **Performance Impact**: Eliminated lag during dragging, smooth 60fps movement

### 6. **Auto-Repositioning Feature (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)**
- **Issue**: When expanding the floating toolbar, parts could extend off-screen making content inaccessible
- **User Experience Problem**: Users would lose access to toolbar controls if panel expanded beyond viewport bounds
- **Solution**: 
  - **Intelligent Repositioning**: Automatically detect when expanded content would go off-screen
  - **Viewport Boundary Detection**: Check all four edges (right, bottom, left, top) for overflow
  - **Smart Positioning**: Move panel to nearest valid position where it's fully visible
  - **Seamless UX**: Repositioning happens automatically without user intervention
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `repositionIfOffScreen` function that calculates optimal panel position
  - Integrated with existing collapse/expand logic using useEffect
  - Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` to get actual panel dimensions after DOM update
  - Calculates new position based on viewport dimensions and panel size
  - Only repositions when necessary to minimize unnecessary movement
  - Preserves user's preferred position when possible
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Triggered when `isCollapsed` changes from true to false (expansion)
  - Uses setTimeout with delays to ensure DOM has updated with new content
  - Checks each viewport edge and adjusts position accordingly
  - Maintains existing auto-docking and drag functionality
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx`
- **UX Impact**: Users can now expand toolbar anywhere on screen without losing access to controls

### 7. **Previous Fixes Maintained**
- **File Upload Dialog Fix**: Preserved solution preventing unintended upload dialogs
- **Canvas Layering**: Maintained transparent painting layer over background images
- **Provider Integration**: All existing AI provider functionality intact
