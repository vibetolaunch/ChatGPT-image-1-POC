# Progress: What Works & What's Left

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop file upload with validation (fixed dialog bug)
- **Canvas Layering**: Fixed image visibility issue - background images now display properly
- **Mask Editing**: Canvas-based painting tools for creating edit masks with transparent overlay
- **AI Generation**: Working integration with Stability AI and Recraft AI
- **Result Display**: Before/after image comparison
- **User Authentication**: Complete Supabase Auth flow with SSR
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for images and masks

### Technical Implementation
- **Provider Pattern**: Clean abstraction for multiple AI services
- **Canvas Architecture**: Proper layering with background canvas (z-index: 1) and transparent painting canvas (z-index: 2)
- **Supabase SSR**: Proper implementation with `@supabase/ssr`
- **Middleware**: Authentication and token refresh working
- **API Routes**: Functional endpoints for image generation
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
- **Database**: Migrations and schema properly set up

### User Experience
- **Unified Interface**: Single-page editing experience
- **Image Visibility**: Uploaded images now display immediately (fixed layering issue)
- **Tool Interaction**: Fixed file upload dialog bug - tools work independently
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback during editing
- **Provider Selection**: Users can choose between AI providers
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Basic error messages and validation

## üöß What's In Progress

### OpenAI Integration
- **Status**: Configuration exists but provider not implemented
- **Blocker**: Requires organization verification for ChatGPT-image-1
- **Files**: `lib/config.ts` has OpenAI config, need provider implementation
- **Impact**: Missing key differentiator of the POC

### Token System
- **Status**: Basic structure exists but disabled
- **Issue**: In-memory storage resets on server restart
- **Workaround**: Feature flag `showTokenPurchase: false`
- **Files**: `lib/tokenService.ts`, Stripe integration ready

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

### File Upload Dialog Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: After uploading an image, clicking other buttons (brush, eraser) would reopen the file upload dialog
- **Root Cause**: Dropzone's `getRootProps()` applied to entire component container, making all clicks trigger file upload
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `getRootProps()` from main container
  - Added dedicated hidden file input with proper event handling
  - Modified upload button to trigger file selection only when clicked
  - Preserved drag-and-drop functionality only when upload tool is active
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: File upload dialog now only appears when explicitly intended (clicking Upload button or dragging files)

### Canvas Layering Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Uploaded images were hidden behind white painting canvas background
- **Root Cause**: Painting canvas initialized with `fillRect('#ffffff')` instead of transparent
- **Solution**: Changed initialization to use `clearRect()` for transparency
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Images now display immediately upon upload, proper mask painting workflow restored

## ‚ùå What's Missing

### High Priority Missing Features
1. **OpenAI Provider Implementation**
   - File needed: `lib/providers/OpenAiProvider.ts`
   - Integration with ChatGPT-image-1 model
   - Handle RGBA mask format (different from other providers)

2. **Persistent Token Storage**
   - Move from in-memory to database storage
   - Proper token deduction and tracking
   - Enable token purchase feature

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Better API error messages
   - Network failure recovery
   - Provider-specific error handling

### Medium Priority Missing Features
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Large image handling improvements
   - Canvas performance for high-resolution images
   - Memory management for image processing

2. **Advanced UI Features**
   - Undo/redo functionality for mask editing (basic implementation exists)
   - Enhanced brush size and opacity controls (basic implementation exists)
   - Zoom and pan for large images

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Better visual feedback during generation
   - Image history and management

### Low Priority Missing Features
1. **Additional Providers**
   - Other AI image generation services
   - Provider capability comparison
   - Automatic provider selection

2. **Advanced Editing Features**
   - Multiple mask layers
   - Batch image processing
   - Style transfer options

3. **Production Features**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Monitoring and analytics
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## üîß Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Memory Usage**: Large images can cause browser performance issues
2. **Canvas Limitations**: Very high resolution images may not render properly
3. **Provider Differences**: Mask format conversion between RGBA/grayscale
4. **Token Reset**: Server restart loses all token balances

### User Experience Issues
1. **Loading Feedback**: No progress indication during AI generation
2. **Error Messages**: Generic error messages don't help users understand issues
3. **Mobile Experience**: Canvas editing challenging on mobile devices
4. **File Size Limits**: Different limits per provider can confuse users

### Security Issues (POC Limitations)
1. **Production Hardening**: Missing security measures for production
2. **Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse
3. **Input Validation**: Basic validation, needs enhancement
4. **Error Exposure**: Some internal errors exposed to users
