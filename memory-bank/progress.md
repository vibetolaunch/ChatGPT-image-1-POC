- **Workaround**: Feature flag `showTokenPurchase: false`
- **Files**: `lib/tokenService.ts`, Stripe integration ready

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

### Color Picker UI Fix (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)
- **Issue**: Color picker button displayed a grey border inside the color swatch that couldn't be removed with CSS
- **Root Cause**: Browser default styling for `<input type="color">` elements that overrides CSS attempts to remove borders
- **Solution**: 
  - Created custom color picker using hidden input + visible label approach
  - Hidden the actual `<input type="color">` with `opacity-0` and `absolute` positioning
  - Added visible `<label>` element that displays the current color as a clean swatch
  - Connected label to input via `htmlFor="color-picker"` for proper functionality
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Replaced direct color input styling with hidden input + custom label
  - Label shows current color via `backgroundColor` style property
  - Maintains all functionality - clicking label opens full browser color picker
  - Eliminates all browser-imposed styling while preserving accessibility
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx`
- **Impact**: Color picker now appears as a clean color swatch without any grey borders or visual artifacts

### Export Tool Implementation (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)
- **Feature**: Complete export functionality for saving canvas artwork
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added export tool to floating toolbar with üíæ icon
  - PNG export with transparency support
  - JPG export with configurable quality (default 85%)
  - Layer combination system that merges background and painting canvases
  - Automatic filename generation with timestamps
- **Technical Details**:
  - Creates temporary canvas to combine all layers
  - Fills with white background for both formats (JPG doesn't support transparency)
  - Uses HTML5 Canvas `toBlob()` API for efficient file generation
  - Triggers automatic download using temporary anchor element
  - Proper cleanup of temporary resources
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/FloatingToolPanel.tsx` (added export tool and UI)
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx` (added export handlers)
- **Impact**: Users can now save their artwork in PNG or JPG format with a single click

### Canvas Resize Content Preservation Fix (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)
- **Issue**: When resizing the browser window, all canvas content (uploaded images and brush strokes/masks) was being wiped
- **Root Cause**: The `setupCanvas` function in `EdgeToEdgeCanvas` was clearing both canvases during resize operations without preserving existing content
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented comprehensive content preservation system using `getImageData()` and `putImageData()`
  - Capture content from both background canvas (images) and painting canvas (brush/masks) before resize
  - Restore all preserved content after canvas dimensions and positioning are updated
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `backgroundImageData` and `paintingImageData` variables to capture canvas content
  - Used `getImageData(0, 0, CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT)` to preserve pixel data
  - Performed all canvas setup operations (dimensions, positioning, scaling)
  - Used `putImageData()` to restore both canvases after resize operations
  - Maintains proper canvas layering and transparency
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Users can now resize browser window without losing any work - both uploaded images and painted content are fully preserved while canvas properly scales and repositions

### Apply to Canvas Fix (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)
- **Issue**: "Apply to Canvas" button in AI modal had TODO comment and wasn't functional
- **Root Cause**: Button only closed modal without applying the AI-generated result
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `onApplyToCanvas` callback prop to `AIPromptModal` component
  - Implemented `handleApplyToCanvas` function in `UnifiedPaintingCanvas`
  - Function loads AI result, updates background image, clears mask, saves to history
- **Implementation Details**:
  - AI result becomes new background image with proper dimensions
  - Painting canvas (mask) automatically cleared since edit is applied
  - State saved to history for undo functionality
  - Error handling for image loading failures
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/AIPromptModal.tsx`
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Users can now seamlessly apply AI edits to canvas and continue editing

### UI Redesign - Floating Toolbar & Edge-to-Edge Canvas (COMPLETED)
- **Implementation**: Complete UI overhaul with modern, professional interface
- **New Components**:
  - `FloatingToolPanel.tsx`: Draggable toolbar with glassmorphism design
  - `EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx`: Full-viewport canvas with dark theme
- **Key Features**:
  - Floating toolbar can be positioned anywhere on screen
  - Auto-docking to screen edges when dragged near them
  - Collapsible interface with macOS-style window controls
  - Edge-to-edge canvas with no borders or frames
  - Dark background theme for better image contrast
  - Gradient border glow effect when image is loaded
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Completely refactored `UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
  - Component separation for better maintainability
  - Ref-based communication between components
  - Improved event handling for drawing
- **Impact**: Transformed from traditional fixed-layout to modern, flexible workspace

### File Upload Dialog Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: After uploading an image, clicking other buttons (brush, eraser) would reopen the file upload dialog
- **Root Cause**: Dropzone's `getRootProps()` applied to entire component container, making all clicks trigger file upload
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `getRootProps()` from main container
  - Added dedicated hidden file input with proper event handling
  - Modified upload button to trigger file selection only when clicked
  - Preserved drag-and-drop functionality only when upload tool is active
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: File upload dialog now only appears when explicitly intended (clicking Upload button or dragging files)

### Canvas Layering Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Uploaded images were hidden behind white painting canvas background
- **Root Cause**: Painting canvas initialized with `fillRect('#ffffff')` instead of transparent
- **Solution**: Changed initialization to use `clearRect()` for transparency
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Images now display immediately upon upload, proper mask painting workflow restored
