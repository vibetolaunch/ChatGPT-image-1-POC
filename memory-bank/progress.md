# Progress: What Works & What's Left

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop file upload with validation (fixed dialog bug)
- **Canvas Layering**: Fixed image visibility issue - background images now display properly
- **Mask Editing**: Canvas-based painting tools for creating edit masks with transparent overlay
- **AI Generation**: Working integration with Stability AI and Recraft AI
- **Apply to Canvas**: Fixed critical bug - AI results now properly apply to canvas (2025-05-25)
- **Result Display**: Before/after image comparison
- **User Authentication**: Complete Supabase Auth flow with SSR
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for images and masks

### Technical Implementation
- **Provider Pattern**: Clean abstraction for multiple AI services
- **Canvas Architecture**: Proper layering with background canvas (z-index: 1) and transparent painting canvas (z-index: 2)
- **Supabase SSR**: Proper implementation with `@supabase/ssr`
- **Middleware**: Authentication and token refresh working
- **API Routes**: Functional endpoints for image generation
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
- **Database**: Migrations and schema properly set up

### User Experience (MAJOR UPDATE)
- **Floating Toolbar**: Draggable, collapsible toolbar with glassmorphism design
- **Edge-to-Edge Canvas**: Full viewport canvas with no borders or frames
- **Dark Theme**: Professional editing environment with better contrast
- **Auto-docking**: Toolbar snaps to screen edges for optimal positioning
- **Tool Integration**: Brush, eraser, upload tools with real-time controls
- **Responsive Design**: Viewport-aware scaling and positioning
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states
- **Seamless AI Workflow**: Complete AI generation and application workflow

## üöß What's In Progress

### OpenAI Integration
- **Status**: Configuration exists but provider not implemented
- **Blocker**: Requires organization verification for ChatGPT-image-1
- **Files**: `lib/config.ts` has OpenAI config, need provider implementation
- **Impact**: Missing key differentiator of the POC

### Token System
- **Status**: Basic structure exists but disabled
- **Issue**: In-memory storage resets on server restart
- **Workaround**: Feature flag `showTokenPurchase: false`
- **Files**: `lib/tokenService.ts`, Stripe integration ready

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

### Apply to Canvas Fix (COMPLETED - 2025-05-25)
- **Issue**: "Apply to Canvas" button in AI modal had TODO comment and wasn't functional
- **Root Cause**: Button only closed modal without applying the AI-generated result
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `onApplyToCanvas` callback prop to `AIPromptModal` component
  - Implemented `handleApplyToCanvas` function in `UnifiedPaintingCanvas`
  - Function loads AI result, updates background image, clears mask, saves to history
- **Implementation Details**:
  - AI result becomes new background image with proper dimensions
  - Painting canvas (mask) automatically cleared since edit is applied
  - State saved to history for undo functionality
  - Error handling for image loading failures
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/AIPromptModal.tsx`
  - `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Users can now seamlessly apply AI edits to canvas and continue editing

### UI Redesign - Floating Toolbar & Edge-to-Edge Canvas (COMPLETED)
- **Implementation**: Complete UI overhaul with modern, professional interface
- **New Components**:
  - `FloatingToolPanel.tsx`: Draggable toolbar with glassmorphism design
  - `EdgeToEdgeCanvas.tsx`: Full-viewport canvas with dark theme
- **Key Features**:
  - Floating toolbar can be positioned anywhere on screen
  - Auto-docking to screen edges when dragged near them
  - Collapsible interface with macOS-style window controls
  - Edge-to-edge canvas with no borders or frames
  - Dark background theme for better image contrast
  - Gradient border glow effect when image is loaded
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Completely refactored `UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
  - Component separation for better maintainability
  - Ref-based communication between components
  - Improved event handling for drawing
- **Impact**: Transformed from traditional fixed-layout to modern, flexible workspace

### File Upload Dialog Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: After uploading an image, clicking other buttons (brush, eraser) would reopen the file upload dialog
- **Root Cause**: Dropzone's `getRootProps()` applied to entire component container, making all clicks trigger file upload
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `getRootProps()` from main container
  - Added dedicated hidden file input with proper event handling
  - Modified upload button to trigger file selection only when clicked
  - Preserved drag-and-drop functionality only when upload tool is active
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: File upload dialog now only appears when explicitly intended (clicking Upload button or dragging files)

### Canvas Layering Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Uploaded images were hidden behind white painting canvas background
- **Root Cause**: Painting canvas initialized with `fillRect('#ffffff')` instead of transparent
- **Solution**: Changed initialization to use `clearRect()` for transparency
- **Files Modified**: `app/image-mask-editor/components/UnifiedPaintingCanvas.tsx`
- **Impact**: Images now display immediately upon upload, proper mask painting workflow restored
