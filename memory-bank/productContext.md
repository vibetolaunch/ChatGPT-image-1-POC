# Product Context: AI Image Editing Platform

## Why This Project Exists
This POC addresses the growing need for developers and organizations to understand and integrate cutting-edge AI image editing capabilities, particularly OpenAI's latest ChatGPT-image-1 model released in April 2025.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. **AI Model Integration Complexity**
- **Problem**: Integrating multiple AI image providers requires understanding different APIs, formats, and constraints
- **Solution**: Unified provider pattern that abstracts differences between OpenAI, Stability AI, and Recraft AI
- **Value**: Developers can easily switch between providers or add new ones

### 2. **Advanced Image Editing Workflow**
- **Problem**: Traditional image editing requires complex software and technical expertise
- **Solution**: Browser-based mask editing with intuitive painting tools
- **Value**: Users can perform sophisticated edits through simple brush strokes

### 3. **ChatGPT-image-1 Exploration**
- **Problem**: New OpenAI model requires organization verification and has unique capabilities
- **Solution**: Ready-to-use integration showcasing the model's potential
- **Value**: Teams can evaluate the model without building integration from scratch

### 4. **Multi-Provider Comparison**
- **Problem**: Difficult to compare quality and capabilities across AI providers
- **Solution**: Single interface supporting multiple providers with consistent UX
- **Value**: Direct comparison of results from different AI models

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Authentication**: User signs up/logs in via Supabase Auth
2. **Image Upload**: User uploads an image to edit
3. **Mask Creation**: User paints areas to modify using canvas tools
4. **Prompt Input**: User describes desired changes
5. **Provider Selection**: User chooses AI provider (OpenAI, Stability AI, Recraft)
6. **Generation**: System processes request and returns edited image
7. **Comparison**: User can view before/after results

### Core Workflows
- **Mask-Based Editing**: Paint areas to modify, system generates changes only in masked regions
- **Multi-Provider Testing**: Same image/mask/prompt across different AI providers
- **Token Management**: Purchase and track API usage tokens via Stripe
- **Result Storage**: Save edited images to Supabase storage

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Experience
- **Intuitive**: No technical knowledge required for basic editing
- **Fast**: Quick feedback loop from edit to result
- **Flexible**: Multiple canvas options (unified painting, tldraw integration)
- **Reliable**: Consistent behavior across different providers

### Secondary Experience
- **Educational**: Learn differences between AI providers
- **Experimental**: Safe environment to test new techniques
- **Scalable**: Easy to extend with new providers or features

## Success Indicators
- Users can successfully edit images using mask painting
- ChatGPT-image-1 integration works seamlessly
- Provider switching is transparent to users
- Authentication and token purchase flow is smooth
- Results are visually compelling and match user intent

## Key Differentiators
- **Latest Technology**: First to showcase ChatGPT-image-1 capabilities
- **Provider Agnostic**: Not locked into single AI service
- **Developer Focused**: Clean architecture for learning and extension
- **Security Conscious**: Proper API key handling and auth patterns
